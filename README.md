This is the assets folder for the unity game I'm developing. I've called the repo CraftingDungeonCrawler because that is what the game is about. If you are seeing this, hi, hello. If you want to use anything from this repository for some reason, just put a credit in your code. I have no way of enforcing this and to be honest I don't really give a damn, but if you DO decide to use stuff in here and the stuff you use becomes part of something worth millions of dollars, hire me pls. Or just give me money. Either one works. Anyways, I'm writing this instead of studying like I should be, so thats all for now. 4/22/2025
