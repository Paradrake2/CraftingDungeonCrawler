This is the assets folder for the unity game I'm developing. I've called the repo CraftingDungeonCrawler because that is what the game is about. If you are seeing this, hi, hello. If you want to use anything from this repository for some reason, just put a credit in your code. I have no way of enforcing this and to be honest I don't really give a damn, but if you DO decide to use stuff in here and the stuff you use becomes part of something worth millions of dollars, hire me pls. Or just give me money. Either one works. I don't think I'll ever publish the game, and so this repository is mostly just for me or if someone wants to see what I'm working on. If, however, you are from the future and I have published this game and it's a major success and I'm making tons of money, wicked, that's awesome. Right now it's 2025 and I'm just a junior college student who wants to be a game developer but is unfortunately planning on doing something else, as I've heard that the work culture around game development sucks. If you are a hiring manager for a game dev studio and you are seeing this, forget I said that, please hire me. Also, what the actual fuck is going on in our country(USA) at the moment?? I mean, I try to stay away from politics because that shit is depressing, but right now we've got in my opinion one of the worst administrations ever. I haven't paid much attention, but I've heard that ICE is rounding up random people with tattoos regardless of citizenship and sending them to El Salvadorian prisons, basically selling them into slavery(according to some people, idk, shit's wack). That's pretty damn concerning. Pretty sure that's what the Nazi's were doing, or something. Getting rid of minorities and "undesirables". Seems like the administration this time around doesn't hate Jews but instead hates poor people, and loves making money. Typical politicians. There's also the isolation of our allies, which is fucking idiotic. Dunno why Trump seems to have such a boner for Russia. Maybe it's cause they bankrolled half his life. Of course, that's going into conspiracy theories, and I'm the kind of person who looks at that stuff and scoffs, so who knows. He did spend the 4th of July in Moscow that one time though. If right now the person reading this is in an apocalyptic scenario or nuclear winter or zombie plague or some other crazy shit, good luck lmao I'm probably long dead. Most likely it'll all be fine, but who knows, maybe I'm writing this right before the USA collapses into anarchy. Pope Francis just died, right after meeting our vice president(btw, that guy gives me the creeps). That can't be a good sign. It'd be pretty crazy if the person reading this is some kind of wasteland explorer scouring the wreckage of a once prosperious, now ruined world. Kinda like the main character in fallout 4 with all those logs in the terminals. Anyways, I'm writing this instead of studying like I should be, so thats all for now. 4/22/2025, 7:12 pm, 19:12 in 24 hour time.
